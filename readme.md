# Responsive Portfolio

Welcome to my Full Stack Dev portfolio web presence. This page is intended to give the audiuance a brief look into my work and demonstrate my ability to use many different technologies.

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, I will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

# Project-Title: 
A Portolio to Be Proud of!

## About This Page 

First, using Bootstrap CSS Framework I have recreated my portfolio. How do you deliver this in a new way? That is a really good question... Here are some guidelines:

* Try to be original and demonstrate your skills as well as you can.

* Using Bootstrap, I have recreated my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio minimizes the use of media queries.


### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.


### What Do You Think About My Portfolio

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project


### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, I have a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on my portfolio site (**Hint:** I used the Bootstrap documentation).


## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

I would like to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so I try to commit early and often!
